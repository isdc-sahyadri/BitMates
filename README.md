Welcome to the **ISDC Hackathon!** 🚀

This hackathon is not just a competition—it’s an opportunity to learn, collaborate, and innovate while working on real-world projects. Our goal is to identify talented peers who will join ISDC and contribute to exciting consultancy projects, helping them earn while they learn and build industry-ready skills.

Through this event, you'll get a hands-on experience of how hackathons work. While this is an online hackathon, the collaboration, problem-solving, and teamwork you develop here will prepare you for bigger challenges, including our upcoming offline hackathon!

So gear up, bring your ideas to life, and show us what you’ve got! 🚀🔥

## **🤔 Problem Statement & What the Project Does**  
Managing tasks efficiently is crucial for productivity. This project helps users **add and delete tasks**, ensuring better organization and time management.  

## **🌍 Why We Chose This Problem Statement**  
Task management is essential for students, professionals, and teams. A lightweight, easy-to-use tool can help streamline daily planning without unnecessary complexity.  

## **⚙️ How It Works**  
1️⃣ **User logs in** to access the task manager.  
2️⃣ **Tasks can be created** with a simple input form.  
3️⃣ **Tasks can be deleted** when no longer needed.  
4️⃣ **Data is stored in MongoDB**, ensuring persistence.  

## **🏆 Challenges Faced & How We Overcame Them**  
- **🔹 Authentication Implementation:** Used `localStorage` to persist login state.  
- **🔹 API Integration:** Debugged CORS issues when connecting frontend and backend.  
- **🔹 State Management:** Ensured real-time task updates with React’s `useState` and `useEffect`.
